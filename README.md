# MNIST-data-using-TensorFlow
Created a 4 layer a neural network model using TensorFlow to recognize hand written digits from MNIST dataset.
Optimized the cost function using Adamoptimizer and obtained an accuracy of 96.02%

WIP - Different activation functions and number of hidden layer to find a perfect balance for Loss and Accuracy
